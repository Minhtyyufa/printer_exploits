## To install dependencies

## Denial of Service Exploit

The denial of service exploit will disable printing for your Brother HL-L2315DW indefinitely. To run the exploit, first configure the program by adding your printer's IP address in the dos.py:

```python
PRINTER_HOST = <YOUR PRINTER'S IP ADDR>
```

To run the attack simply run this command
```
python ./dos.py
```

## NVRAM Destroyer Exploit
CAUTION!!!!! The NVRAM destroyer exploit will take around 24 hours to run and will destroy a portion of the printers NVRAM. This will permanently destroy a part your printer's NVRAM so use with caution. To run this exploit, first configure the program by adding your printer's IP address in the nvram_destroyer_exploit.py:

```python
PRINTER_HOST = <YOUR PRINTER'S IP ADDR>
```

To run the attack simply run this command
```
python ./nvram_destroyer_exploit.py
```

## Bonus
One funny thing that we played around with was changing the "READY" display message. To change the "READY" message to "UH OH" first configure job_sender.py by changing the IP address:

```python
PRINTER_HOST = <YOUR PRINTER'S IP ADDR>
```

Then run the "attack" using
```
python ./job_sender.py ready_msg_test.txt
```
